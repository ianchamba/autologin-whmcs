**WHMCS AutoLogin Module**

This is a WHMCS AutoLogin module that I developed and am sharing openly with the community. Feel free to use and modify it as you see fit. The module was tested on WHMCS 8.11.2, so compatibility with other versions is not guaranteed.

Link Expiration: AutoLogin links expire after 24 hours.
Single-Use Links: Each link can only be used once.
These rules can be customized directly in the code.

Download and extract the .zip file.
Place the extracted contents in the root directory of your WHMCS installation.
